  defmodule OffBroadway.Polyn.Producer do
    @moduledoc """
    A [Broadway](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway/Broadway.html) Producer for Polyn.

    The word `Producer` here is confusing because the word is overloaded.
    In this module `Producer` refers to [GenStage](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/GenStage.html) data
    pipelines where a `:producer` is the stage that receives demand for data and sends it to a `:consumer`.
    This module doesn't "produce" new events that get added to the NATS server for other services to consume.
    Rather it consumes existing events from a NATS Stream and passes them to GenStage `:consumer` modules
    in one application.

    ## Usage

    This module wraps `OffBroadway.Jetstream.Producer` and will validate that any messages coming through
    are valid events and conform to the schema for the event. Use the `OffBroadway.Jetstream.Producer` documentation
    to learn how to use it. One difference is that you will use `OffBroadway.Polyn.Producer`
    in your `:module` configuration instead of the Jetstream one. Invalid messages will send an ACKTERM
    to the NATS server so that they aren't sent again. They will be marked as `failed` and removed from the pipeline.
    Valid messages that come in a batch with an invalid message will send a NACK response before an error
    is raised so that the NATS server will know they were received but need to be sent again

    Another key difference that Polyn adds is that the `:consumer_name` will be taken care of for you
    by using the passed `type` and configured `:source_root`. You can pass in a `:source` to `:module`
    to get a more specific `:consumer_name`.
